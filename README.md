## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this specific challenge, I learned how to add a gradient to text, as I had not done this before.

```css
.gradient-text {
  background: var(--clr-gradient-titles);
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

Finding ways to better organize my codeâ€”for example, naming my classes or variables properly, as well as creating components or utility classes to reuse code more effectively throughout the page.
